# Hi there, I'm [Your Name] 👋

### 🚀 Software Engineer | Fullstack Developer | Aspiring Cloud Architect

I am a passionate **Software Engineer** with a strong foundation in modern web/app development and on-premise/cloud infrastructure. Currently, I am focused on bridging the gap between writing code and **architecting scalable systems**.

My goal is to join a forward-thinking engineering team building **large-scale platforms**, where I can contribute to solving complex real-world problems while deepening my expertise in **Distributed Systems** and the **AWS Ecosystem**.

## 👨‍💻 What I Bring to the Table

* **Engineering Mindset:** I don't just write code; I focus on maintainability, performance, and the "why" behind every technical decision.
* **Fullstack Versatility:** Comfortable traversing the stack from frontend UI (React/Next.js) to backend logic (Node.js/Go) and infrastructure (AWS/Docker).
* **Passion for Scale:** I am actively studying high-availability patterns, database optimization, and serverless architectures to handle real-world traffic loads.
