# Hi there, I'm Nguyen Trung Kien 👋

### 👨‍💻 Software Engineer | Full Stack Developer | DevOps Engineer

I am a mid-level Software Engineer with a passion for building robust applications and solving complex, real-world problems. My primary focus is on writing clean, maintainable code, but I differentiate myself by deeply understanding **how applications are deployed and scaled**.

I am looking to join a team building **large-scale systems**, where I can contribute my development skills while further mastering cloud architecture and system scalability.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

My daily drivers for building feature-rich applications:

### **Backend Development**
* **Frameworks:** NestJS (Node.js), Laravel (PHP).
* **Database:** MySQL, PostgreSQL.
* **API Design:** RESTful APIs, Microservices communication.

### **Frontend Development**
* **Frameworks:** Next.js, React.
* **UI Libraries:** Ant Design, Tailwind CSS.
* **Focus:** Responsive design and seamless user experience.

## 🚀 Infrastructure & Deployment

Beyond writing code, I have hands-on experience deploying applications in both **On-Premise** and **Cloud** environments. I view this as a crucial skillset for modern engineering—understanding not just *how to code it*, but *where it lives*.

### **☁️ AWS Cloud (Serverless & Services)**
I use these tools to build scalable, highly available backends:
* **Compute:** AWS Lambda, Step Functions.
* **Integration:** SQS, SNS (Event-driven patterns).
* **Security & Networking:** AWS IAM, Cognito, Route53, CloudFront.
* **Infrastructure:** AWS CloudFormation, CloudWatch, S3.

### **🖥️ On-Premise & Linux Ops**
I am comfortable working directly with the OS to manage deployments:
* **OS:** Ubuntu Linux (Command Line proficiency).
* **Web Servers:** Nginx, Apache.
* **Architecture:** Experience with Microservices Architecture and manual deployment strategies.

## 🎯 Professional Goals & Mindset

* **Scalability Interest:** I am actively learning how to bridge the gap between application logic and high-traffic infrastructure (Scale-up platforms).
* **Problem Solving:** I am passionate about using technology to solve actual business problems, not just following tutorials.
* **Growth:** I am seeking a challenging environment where I can evolve from a developer into a system-aware engineer capable of handling massive user bases.
